                suite using the Altera SDK for OpenCL targeting a Stratix V FPGA
                against a modern CPU and GPU. We study multiple OpenCL kernels
                per benchmark, ranging from direct ports of the original GPU
                implementations to loop-pipelined kernels specifically optimized
                for FPGAs. Based on our results, we find that even though OpenCL
                is functionally portable across devices, direct ports of
                GPU-optimized code do not perform well compared to kernels
                optimized with FPGA-specific techniques such as sliding windows.
                However, by exploiting FPGA-specific optimizations, it is
                possible to achieve up to 3.4x better power efficiency using an
                Altera Stratix V FPGA in comparison to an NVIDIA K20c GPU, and
                better run time and power efficiency in comparison to CPU. We
                also present preliminary results for Arria 10, which, due to
                hardened FPUs, exhibits noticeably better performance compared to
                Stratix V in floating-point-intensive benchmarks.},

    abstract = {Large-scale graph processing poses challenges due to its size
                and irregular memory access patterns, causing performance
                degradation in common architectures, such as CPUs and GPUs.
                Recent research includes accelerating graph processing using
                Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). FPGAs can provide very
                efficient acceleration thanks to reconfigurable on-chip
                resources. Although limited, these resources offer a larger
                design space than CPUs and GPUs. We propose an approach in which
                data are preprocessed in small chunks with an optimized graph
                partitioning technique for execution on FPGA accelerators. The
                chunks, located on the host, are streamed directly into a
                customized memory layer implemented in the FPGA, which is tightly
                coupled with the processing elements responsible for the graph
                algorithm execution. This improves application memory access
                latency, which is crucial in large-sale graph computing
                performance. This work presents a hardware design that, combined
                with graph partitioning, enables us to achieve high-performance
                and potentially scalable handling of large graphs (i.e., graphs
                with millions of vertices and billions of edges in current
                scenarios) while using popular graph algorithms. The proposed
                framework accelerates performance 56 times compared with CPU
                (multicore with 16 logical cores in our reference experiments),
                2.5 times and 4 times faster compared to state-of-the-art FPGA
                and GPU solutions (FPGA has 15 compute units, and GPU reference
                has 128 streaming-multiprocessors in our experiments),
                respectively, when using the PageRank algorithm. For the
                Single-Source-Shortest-Past (SSSP) algorithm, we achieve speedups
                of up to 65x, 26x, and 18x compared to CPU, GPU, and FPGA works,
                respectively. Lastly, in the context of the Weakly Connected
                Component (WCC) algorithm, our framework achieves a speedup of up
                to 403 times compared to the CPU, 7.4x against the GPU, and it is
                faster than the FPGA alternatives up to 10.3x.},

    abstract = {With CPU scaling slowing down in today's data centers, 
                more functionalities are being offloaded from the CPU to 
                auxiliary devices. One such device is the SmartNIC, which is 
                being increasingly adopted in data centers. In today's cloud 
                environment, VMs on the same server can each have their own network 
                computation (or network tasks) or workflows of network tasks to 
                offload to a SmartNIC. These network tasks can be dynamically 
                added/removed as VMs come and go and can be shared across VMs. 
                Such dynamism demands that a SmartNIC not only schedules and 
                processes packets but also manages and executes offloaded network 
                tasks for different users. Although software solutions like an OS 
                exist for managing software-based network tasks, such software-based 
                SmartNICs cannot keep up with the quickly increasing data-center network speed. 
                This paper proposes a new SmartNIC platform called SuperNIC that allows multiple 
                tenants to efficiently and safely offload FPGA-based network computation DAGs. 
                For efficiency and scalability, our core idea is to group network tasks into 
                virtual chains that are dynamically mapped to different forms of physical 
                chains depending on load and FPGA space availability. We further propose 
                techniques to automatically scale network task chains with different types of 
                parallelism. Moreover, we propose a fair sharing mechanism that considers both fair 
                space sharing and fair time sharing of different types of hardware resources. Our FPGA 
                prototype of SuperNIC achieves high bandwidth and low latency performance whilst 
                efficiently utilizing and fairly sharing resources.},
